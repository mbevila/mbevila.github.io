I am a first year PhD candidate and research fellow doing NLP in a Computer Science Department, coming from a Linguistics background. My supervisor is prof. Roberto Navigli. My main topic of interest is neural approaches to word-level semantics, supervised (Word Sense Disambiguation) or unsupervised (language model pretraining).
